      ### Option 1: Check pnpm website for updated installation (preferred)
      - name: Check pnpm installation guide
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            # Escape backslashes and dollar signs in the regular expression
            curl -sL https://pnpm.io/installation | grep -o '\`bash.*?\`$' | tr '\n' ' '

      ### Option 2: Use npm as an alternative (if pnpm installation issues persist)
      # This step remains commented out, ready for use if needed.
      # - name: Install dependencies (npm)  # Uncomment if pnpm issues persist
      #   run: npm install

      - name: Install dependencies (based on check)
        run: |
          # Check if pnpm installation instructions were retrieved
          if [[ -n ${{ steps.check_pnpm_installation.outputs.result }} ]]; then
            echo "Installing pnpm using retrieved instructions..."
            ${{ steps.check_pnpm_installation.outputs.result }}  # Use retrieved command
          else
            echo "pnpm installation check failed, falling back to npm..."
            npm install  # Fallback to npm if check fails
          fi

      - name: Restore cache
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            .next/cache
            node_modules  # Add node_modules for test dependencies
          # Generate a new cache whenever packages or source files change.
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-${{ hashFiles('**.[jt]s', '**.[jt]sx') }}

      - name: Upload artifact (optional)

        with:
          name: nextjs-build  # Customize the artifact name
          path: ./out
          # You can upload the build output as an artifact for further use
